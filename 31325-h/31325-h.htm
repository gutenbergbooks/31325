<h3>HISTORY</h3>

<p>The first mention of bats in Nebraska possibly was by Harrison
Allen, in his "Monograph of the Bats of North America" (1864:14,
20, 30, 35, 42), who listed <i>Nycticejus crepuscularis</i> [= <i>Nycticeius
humeralis</i>], <i>Lasiurus borealis</i>, <i>Scotophilus carolinensis</i> and <i>Scotophilus
fuscus</i> [both = <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>], and <i>Scotophilus noctivagans</i>
[= <i>Lasionycteris noctivagans</i>], as collected in "Nebraska"
(then Nebraska Territory) by J. G. Cooper. Henry W. Setzer (in
<i>litt.</i>) reports that none of the bats collected by Cooper now exists
in the United States National Museum and that no data pertaining
to any of them are available except that a single specimen of <i>Nycticeius
humeralis</i> was traded to the British Museum in 1866. Cooper
journeyed through parts of the present state of Nebraska in the
summer and autumn of 1857 and, judging from Taylor's (1919:72-80)
report of Cooper's travels, this was the only time he entered
any part of Nebraska Territory. The writers are of the opinion
that the specimens in question probably were collected in Nebraska;
but since Allen listed no exact localities or dates of collection and
since the specimens and data pertaining to them are not now available,
we have not included them here as Nebraskan records.</p>

<p>In the first comprehensive account of Nebraskan mammals, Myron
H. Swenk (1908:137-139) listed six kinds of bats, <i>Myotis evotis</i>,
<i>Myotis californicus ciliolabrum</i> [= <i>Myotis subulatus subulatus</i>],
<i>Lasionycteris noctivagans</i>, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, <i>Lasiurus borealis</i>, and
<i>Lasiurus cinereus</i>, as occurring within the state. Zimmer (1913:665)
recorded <i>Nyctinomus mexicanus</i> [= <i>Tadarida mexicana</i>] from
Nebraska. Subsequently, Swenk (1915:854) reported <i>Myotis lucifugus
lucifugus</i> in the state and three years later (1918:411) he
reported <i>Eptesicus fuscus pallidus</i> for the first time. The report of
<i>M. l. lucifugus</i> seemingly was not substantiated by any actual specimens.
The addition of <i>Myotis volans interior</i> (Quay, 1948:181)
brought to ten the number of species and subspecies of bats reported
from the state.</p>

<p>In the present paper, <i>Myotis keenii septentrionalis</i>, <i>Myotis lucifugus
carissima</i>, and <i>Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus</i> are reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
from Nebraska for the first time. Also, the first authentic record of
<i>Myotis lucifugus lucifugus</i> is presented, along with additional information
on previously reported species. A total number of 169
specimens from Nebraska was available for the present study. This
includes almost all of the known specimens preserved in all collections
as well as material obtained by us in the past six years.</p>

<p>Nebraska has no natural caves or caverns; however, there are two
extensive man-made limestone caves near Louisville, in Cass and
Sarpy counties, where four kinds of bats have been found. Two of
these are here reported as new to Nebraska. The quarries, one on
either side of the Platte River Valley, are in a horizontal stratum of
limestone 40 feet in thickness, and are of the room and pillar type;
that is to say, the stone has been quarried away leaving rooms having
supporting pillars approximately every 50 feet. The average
temperatures in summer and winter within these tunnels, recorded
over a period of several years by the Ash Grove Lime and Portland
Cement Company of Louisville, are 65&deg; F. and 50&deg; F. respectively.
The Kiewit Stone Quarry, abandoned since 1936, is one-half mile
west of Meadow, Sarpy County, and has one remaining entrance
measuring approximately 30 by 30 feet. This quarry has an area
of approximately one-fifth square mile and is usually flooded with
several feet of water. The other man-made cave, known formerly
as the National Stone Quarry, is one mile northeast of Louisville,
Cass County. This quarry was abandoned in September, 1938, and
until the winter of 1948-1949 had eight or nine entrances and two
air shafts. It was approximately one-third square mile in area. All
the openings to this quarry were covered in late 1949. Bats were
first observed in the National Stone Quarry by one of us (Webb)
as early as 1939, less than a year after operations in the quarry
ceased.</p>


<h3>METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Records of Nebraskan bats are arranged in two categories; specimens examined
and additional records. The latter refer to citations in the literature.
Genera are arranged according to Simpson (1945:59, 60), and species are
listed alphabetically under each genus. Specimens examined are in the personal
collection of the authors unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>In connection with this study the authors acknowledge the assistance of
Drs. Edson H. Fichter, Department of Biological Sciences, Idaho State College,
and E. Raymond Hall and Rollin H. Baker, University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History for critical assistance with the manuscript. We are indebted
to Mr. Richard B. Loomis, University of Kansas, for aid in collecting specimens;

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known from limestone quarries in Cass and
Sarpy counties. Probably in other parts of extreme eastern Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 35, as follows: <span class="smcap">Cass Co.</span>:
1 mi. NE Louisville, 4. <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>: 1/2 mi. W Meadow, 31 (some of these
specimens have been deposited in other collections as follows: Private Collection

Forestation and Parks Comm., 1; Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., 2; Univ. Nebr.
State Mus., 7).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Although not so common as <i>Pipistrellus</i> in the limestone
quarries, hibernating bats of this species frequently are found
there, usually as solitary individuals either in drill holes or clinging
to the walls of the quarries; occasionally, however, two or three bats
have been found together in a single drill hole.</p>


<h4>Myotis lucifugus carissima <span style="font-weight: normal">Thomas<br /><br />

Brown Myotis</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Myotis (Leuconoe) carissima</i> Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., (ser. 7),
13:383, May, 1904, type from Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National
Park, Wyoming.</p>

<p><i>Myotis lucifugus carissima</i>, Cary, N. Amer. Fauna, 42:43, October 3, 1917.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known from a single record in extreme northwestern
Nebraska, but probably occurs throughout Panhandle of state.</p>

<p><i>Record of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimen examined, 1, as follows: <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>:
Agate, 1 (Univ. Mich. Mus. Zool.).</p></div>


<h4>Myotis lucifugus lucifugus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Le Conte)<br /><br />

Brown Myotis</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>V[espertilio]. lucifugus</i> Le Conte, McMurtrie's Cuvier, Animal Kingdom,
1:431, June, 1831, type from Georgia, probably from the Le Conte Plantation,
near Riceboro, Liberty County.</p>

<p><i>Myotis lucifugus [lucifugus]</i>, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:59, October 16,
1897.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known only from the limestone quarry in Sarpy
County, but probably occurs over most of eastern third of state.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 2, as follows: <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>:
1/2 mi. W Meadow, 2 (Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., 1).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Two bats of this subspecies were found in the quarry
in Sarpy County on December 30, 1949. None was found on subsequent
visits to the quarry, although three other species of bats
have been found there in large numbers. These specimens appear
to be the first actual records of <i>M. l. lucifugus</i> in the state, although
Swenk (1915:854, and in subsequent lists) reported it as "uncommon
eastwardly".</p>

<p>One of these bats, a male (KU 35076), possesses a peculiar dental
abnormality. Both of the second upper premolars (P3) are lacking,
although the mandibular dentition is normal. This condition has
been reported previously for this species by Frum (1946:176) in
specimens from West Virginia.</p>


<h4>Myotis subulatus subulatus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Say)<br /><br />

Small-footed Myotis</span></h4>

<p><i>Myotis subulatus</i>, Warren, The Mammals of Colorado, G. P. Putnam's Sons,
New York, 1910. p. 275.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Northern and western Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 9, as follows: <span class="smcap">Cherry Co.</span>:
Valentine, 1 (Univ. Nebr. Dept. Zool.). <span class="smcap">Sheridan Co.</span>: Rushville, 1; 15 mi.
N Rushville, 2. <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>: Agate, 1 (Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.); Monroe
Canyon, 5-1/2 mi. N, 2-1/2 mi. W Harrison, 2 (Nebr. Game, Forestation and Parks
Comm.); Warbonnet Canyon, 2 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.).</p>

<p>Additional records: <span class="smcap">Dakota Co.</span>: Crystal Lake, 1 (Stephens, 1945:92).
<span class="smcap">Dawes Co.</span>: Chadron, 1 (Miller and Allen, 1928:169). <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>: Antelope
Township, 1 (Quay, 1948:181); Sugarloaf Township, 1 (Quay, 1948:181).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This bat is common along the Niobrara River in the
northwestern part of the state. Stephens (<i>loc. cit.</i>) reports taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
a bat of this species in Dakota County in the northeastern corner of
Nebraska. This specimen was sent to Swenk at the University of
Nebraska for positive identification and was, according to Stephens,
deposited in the Swenk collection. No trace of the specimen can
be found at the present time. It is here assigned to <i>M. s. subulatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>M. s. subulatus</i> has been observed frequently in the Pine Ridge
area, generally in association with <i>Eptesicus fuscus pallidus</i>. Two
specimens were shot by us from many that were seen flying over
a small clearing in the pines in northern Sioux County on August 2,
1949. Several <i>Eptesicus</i> were also obtained there. One of us
(Webb) took two of these bats from their daytime retreat in a barn
north of Rushville, Sheridan County, on September 5, 1951, where
<i>Eptesicus</i> was also found. They are known to inhabit hay barns at
the Ft. Niobrara Game Reserve, Cherry County, also in association
with <i>Eptesicus</i>. Swenk (1908:137) reports finding two of these bats
under a loose strip of pine bark in Sioux County.</p>


<h4>Myotis volans interior <span style="font-weight: normal">Miller<br /><br />

Hairy-winged Myotis</span></h4>

state.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 2, as follows: <span class="smcap">Sioux Co.</span>:
Warbonnet Township, 8 mi. N Harrison, 2 (Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist.).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Quay (1948:181) reported finding a colony of approximately
180 of these bats in northern Sioux County in the summer
of 1944. They were found in a crevice in a dry creek bed. He examined
several dozen, all females, two of which were saved as
specimens.</p>

<p>The authors, while engaged in field work in this approximate
locality in the summers of 1948 and 1949, were unable to locate any
of these bats.</p>


<h4>Lasionycteris noctivagans <span style="font-weight: normal">(Le Conte)<br /><br />

Silver-haired Bat</span></h4>

<h4>Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus <span style="font-weight: normal">(F. Cuvier)<br /><br />

Eastern Pipistrelle</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>V[espertilio]. subflavus</i> F. Cuvier, Nouv. Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, 1:17,
1832, type from eastern United States, probably Georgia.</p>

<p><i>Pipistrellus subflavus</i>, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:90, October 16, 1897.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Known from limestone quarries in Cass and
Sarpy counties; probably ranging throughout eastern Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Records of occurrence.</i>&mdash;Specimens examined, 34, as follows: <span class="smcap">Cass Co.</span>:
1 mi. NE Louisville, 4. <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>: 1/2 mi. W Meadow, 30 (some of these
specimens have been deposited in other collections as follows: Private Collection
of P. H. Krutzsch, 3; Private Collection of W. G. Frum, 2; Univ. Kansas
Mus. Nat. Hist., 4; Univ. Nebr. State Mus., 4).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This bat is the most common of the four species that
are known to inhabit the quarries in Cass and Sarpy counties. Individuals
have been found both in drill holes and clinging to the
walls of the quarries. We have always found this bat to be solitary
while in hibernation.</p>


<h4>Eptesicus fuscus fuscus <span style="font-weight: normal">(Beauvois)<br /><br />

Big Brown Bat</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Vespertilio fuscus</i> Beauvois, Catal. Raisonn&eacute; Mus. Peale, Philadelphia, p. 18,
1796, type from Philadelphia, Philadelphia Co., Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, M&eacute;hely, Magyarorsz&aacute;g denev&eacute;reinek monographi&aacute;ja (Monographia
Chiropterorum Hungariae), pp. 206, 338, 1900.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Nebraska.</i>&mdash;Eastern part of state.</p>

Louisville, 6; Plattsmouth, 1 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.). <span class="smcap">Sarpy Co.</span>: 1/2 mi. W
Meadow, 15 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus., 7).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;We have observed this bat hibernating in the limestone
quarries of Cass and Sarpy counties, where it was commonly
found in drill holes or clinging to the ceiling or walls. We have always
found this bat to be solitary while in hibernation, with one
exception. On January 31, 1949, a male and female were found in
the same drill hole in the Cass County quarry. The jolt of being
knocked from the hole separated the two bats, and upon examination
the penis of the male was noted to be extended and erected, indicating
that the pair might have been in the act of copulation.</p>

Comm.); Warbonnet Canyon, 7 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;A colony of approximately 100 of these bats was discovered
in the unused portion of a barn loft at Ft. Niobrara Game
Reserve on August 11, 1948. Although no temperature readings
were taken, it was estimated that the temperature was more than
100&deg; F. in the loft. The bats were congregated on rafters at the
north end of the barn and when disturbed, only a few members of
the colony dropped from the rafters to fly. Most of the bats crawled
to new retreats between the rafters and the corrugated iron roof of
the building.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The Mexican free-tailed bat is probably rare in Nebraska.
The single specimen examined by us was obtained on June
27, 1931, from a downtown business building in Lincoln. According
to the label on the specimen, it died in captivity on June 29 after
giving birth to one young on June 28. The bat reported by Zimmer
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) was also taken in the business district of Lincoln. It was
obtained on August 15, 1913.</p>

<p>In addition to the bats named above, six other kinds possibly occur
in Nebraska. These, along with an indication of the part of the
state in which each is to be looked for, are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><i>Myotis grisescens</i> Howell, southeastern part of state.</li>

<li><i>Myotis sodalis</i> Miller and Allen, southeastern part of state.</li>

<li><i>Myotis thysanodes thysanodes</i> Miller, northwestern part of state.</li>

<li><i>Nycticeus humeralis humeralis</i> (Rafinesque), southeastern part of state.</li>

<li><i>Corynorhinus rafinesquii pallescens</i> (Miller), northwestern part of state.</li>

<li><i>Tadarida molossa</i> (Pallas), any part of state.</li>
</ul>
